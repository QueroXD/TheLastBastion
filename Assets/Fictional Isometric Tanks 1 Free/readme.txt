This pack includes 7 fictional isometric armoured vehicles inspired by German WW2 designs. There are different sprites with shooting, moving and scanning animations. They are all in 512x512 resolution. The free pack has animations for armoured car and medium tank. For a small payment you can get the rest.

The animations look good in 10-15 FPS. Here are the included animations:
-Shooting animation 8 frames.
-Moving animation 20 frames (loops).
-Scanning animation 30 frames (frames 7 and 22 are stationary if you want to keep the turret turned longer).

Everything else is made by me, but the muzzle flash and exhaust fumes textures are from:
